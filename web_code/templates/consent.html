                        This research is being conducted by Prof. Thomas Griffiths, a faculty 
                        member at the University of California at Berkeley. His lab 
                        investigates computational models of human cognition. This study 
                        typically takes about 10<b>?</b> minutes.

                        If you agree to take part in the research, you will be asked to look at 
                        a series of images that represent experimental data, and use this 
                        information to make judgments about those experiments.
                        All of the information we obtain during the research will be kept 
                        confidential, and not associated with your name in any way.
